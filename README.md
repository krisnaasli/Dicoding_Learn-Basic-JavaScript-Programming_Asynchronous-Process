# Coding assignment "Learn Basic JavaScript Programming" Asynchronous Process Module
## Description 
### There are 2 main.js, 1 util.js programs as follows:
#### * Coding Quiz: Converting an Asynchronous Callback-Based Function to Promise-Based (main.js)
This program consists of a function called getProvinces, which initially uses a callback-based approach to retrieve province data from a country. In addition, there is logic to convert the function to Promise-based using util.promisify, as well as logic to handle the resulting Promise.
The purpose of this program is to convert the callback-based asynchronous approach in the getProvinces function to a Promise-based approach. This is done to make the code cleaner, easier to understand, and to use modern JavaScript features like async/await.
So, this program is a JavaScript script that aims to change the callback approach to Promise in the getProvinces function, allowing the use of a more modern and efficient Promise-based API.
#### * Coding Quiz: Asynchronous Chained Processing (main.js, util.js)
This program consists of two JavaScript files: main.js and util.js. The main.js file contains the getTollAccess function that aims to access the toll road in a specific sequence of steps. The util.js file contains the implementation of the functions required to purchase a toll card, top up the toll card balance, and use the toll road access.
The purpose of this program is to simulate the process of purchasing a toll card, charging a toll card balance, and using toll road access in stages. These processes are implemented using async/await and Promise. The program also handles errors that may occur during the process and displays them to the console.
So, this program is a simple simulation that uses async/await and Promise to manage the sequence of steps to be taken to access the toll road, and handle errors that may occur during the process.
